# DevOps

DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. 

Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).

Here you will find some tools and configuration examples for setting up a devops environment.

The examples refer to the `wdemo` project present in the repository `https://github.com/giosil/multi-rpc`.
